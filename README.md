# Samsung-User-Dictionary-Parser
Python parser that parses the dynamic.lm file that is retrieved from a Samsung device. The keyboard data is stored in the dynamic.lm file. The typed words and word sequences that are used on the device are found in this file. The word sequences are saved in a 'Trie' structure.
